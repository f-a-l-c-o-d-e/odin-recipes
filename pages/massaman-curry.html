        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Massaman curry is a rich and flavorful Thai dish that combines influences from Indian and Malay cuisines. It's a mild, slightly sweet curry with a complex flavor profile, characterized by the use of warm spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and cumin, which are more commonly found in Indian cooking. The curry paste is made from ingredients like dried chilies, garlic, lemongrass, galangal, shallots, and shrimp paste, blended with the fragrant spices.</p>
        <p>The curry is typically made with meat, such as beef, chicken, or lamb, which is slow-cooked until tender. Potatoes, onions, and peanuts are commonly added to the dish, absorbing the flavors of the sauce. Coconut milk gives Massaman curry its creamy texture and rich taste, while tamarind paste adds a subtle tanginess.</p>
        <p>Massaman curry is usually served with steamed jasmine rice, which helps to balance the rich flavors of the curry. It's a comforting and hearty dish, celebrated for its balance of sweet, savory, and slightly spicy notes.</p>
