        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tomato pasta is a classic dish featuring pasta served with a rich tomato-based sauce. The sauce is typically made from ripe tomatoes, which are simmered down with garlic, onions, olive oil, and herbs like basil, oregano, and thyme. The sauce can be smooth or chunky, depending on preference, and is often seasoned with salt, pepper, and sometimes a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.</p>
        <p>Tomato pasta can be made with various types of pasta, such as spaghetti, penne, or fusilli, and it can be customized with additional ingredients like ground meat, vegetables, or cheese. The simplicity of the dish allows the fresh, tangy flavor of the tomatoes to shine, making it a comforting and satisfying meal. It's often garnished with fresh basil leaves and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.</p>
